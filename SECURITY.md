## Reporting a Vulnerability

I take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue in Email Validator, please report it to me **privately** to give me time to address it before public disclosure.

### How to Report

Please send an email to: **preetam1@outlook.com**

Include the following details:

- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact
- Any relevant code or logs
- Your contact information (optional, for follow-up)

I will respond as soon as possible and keep you informed about the resolution progress.
